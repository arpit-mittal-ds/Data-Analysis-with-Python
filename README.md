# Data-Analysis-with-Python
Using Python to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, and predict future trends from data!  
1) Importing Datasets  
2) Cleaning the Data  
3) Dataframe manipulation 
4) Summarizing the Data  
5) Building machine learning Regression models  
6) Building data pipelines with Python   

Data Analysis libraries: Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset.  Use pandas, an open-source library, to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets.  Use scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions. 

Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Example
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
  
  
l = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	#list	
t = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	#tuple	
x = range(6)	#range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	#dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	#set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	#frozenset	
x = True	#bool	
x = b"Hello"	bytes	
x = bytearray(5)	bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))
