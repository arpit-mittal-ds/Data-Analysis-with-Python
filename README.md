# Data-Analysis-with-Python
Using Python to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualizations, and predict future trends from data!  
1) Importing Datasets  
2) Cleaning the Data  
3) Dataframe manipulation 
4) Summarizing the Data  
5) Building machine learning Regression models  
6) Building data pipelines with Python   

Data Analysis libraries: Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to work with a sample dataset.  Use pandas, an open-source library, to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets.  Use scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
